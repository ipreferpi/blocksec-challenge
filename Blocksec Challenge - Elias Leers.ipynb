    "Blocksec is on the cutting edge of cryptocurrency security -- no one on the team is expected to know everything,\n",

    "Blocks contain metadata along with a(possibly empty) array of transactions that are contained in the block.\n",
    "Transactions are structured as JSON objects where the human readable fields provide sufficient information to\n",

    "1. Coinbase should raise the number of confirmations for all coins and tokens that run on blockchains with a low hashrate.\n",
    "Ideally this number should be at least several weeks, due to the availability of rented hashpower.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Coinbase should share any suspicions of double spend activity with other exchanges to lower the potential value lost\n",

    "are larger than the cost to rent the entire hashrate of that network for more than 24 hours.\n",

    "Coinbase should also monitor larger blockchains experiencing a sudden drop in hashrate, as that could signal an attack\n",
